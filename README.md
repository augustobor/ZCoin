# z-coin

### ZCoin is a web project SPA which simulate a defi exchange.    

### In the website you could see:

- Ethereum projects

- Exchange in ETH

- A FOMO index

#### This website is responsive and with vue router I created a menu in mobile and tablet versions. 

#### All the project is built with vue-cli and would be able to connect your wallet and simulate an exchange in web 3.
